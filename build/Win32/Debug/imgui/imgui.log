         You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
         changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
         state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.
         
         If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
         do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:
         
           git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
         
         HEAD is now at 72dde4d... Version 1.46
         fatal: 'submodule' appears to be a git command, but we were not
         able to execute it. Maybe git-submodule is broken?
